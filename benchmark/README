It's simple benchmark suite, just to know how it works :)

 * txconsumer/txpublisher are tests for txAMQP, it's slightly modified examples from txamqp source code
  - for this scripts you have to download amqp0-8.xml spec file (from txamqp source code)

 * node.py is a nodeset.core node which can work in 'subscriber' or 'publisher' mode
  - run as subscriber:
    $ /usr/bin/python2.6 node.py subscriber -e simple_event --reply
  - run as publisher
    $ /usr/bin/python2.6 node.py publisher -e simple_event -m 5 --reply

  Use --reply option only in case when you want to measure message round-trip (subscriber replies to publisher as well)
