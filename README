NodeSet right now is on rapid development. Code will be changed and APIs too.

* NodeSet Framework

NodeSet is based on Foolscap[1] RPC and twisted[2]. This framework provides a way to build distributed services
on top of publish/subscribe interface. Each Node is a separate unix process, and all events delivering are performed
by dispatcher, the special unix process (also based on foolscap RPC).

* NodeSet components:
1. EventDispatcher - runs on its own, just listen for incoming foolscap RPC calls, and trace which nodes are available,
    and its health.
2. Node - Each Node can act as publisher, as well as subscribers. 
 2.1 StreamNode - special node for streaming. Streaming performed without dispatcher, to avoid performance penalty.

* Goals
 - Distributed (each host has only one dispatcher, but many nodes. Events can be delivered between hosts)
 - Stateless (any node doesn't rely to dispatcher, if dispatcher will die, it does not affect nodes, as well as
     death of any nodes, does not affect other nodes and dispatcher)
 - Async (as well NodeSet is based on twisted, it's all about async programming :)
 
* Install (easy_install based)

python setup.py install (or develop for development)

* Examples

There are few examples of NodeSet framework usage:
 * mnode.py - example of NodeCollection, as well as Node usage. Subscription example
 * mnode_publish.py - example of publishing
 * stream-node.py - example of StreamNode usage
 * performance1.py - to test performance of message publishing/subscription, 
      also has an example of NodeSetAppOptions usage

To run any of example, first you must run dispatcher:
 - nodeset-dispatcher [options]

 * Node usage example
  - python mnode.py [options]
  - python mnode_publish.py [options]
 
 * StreamNode usage example
  - python stream-node.py [options]


Options for call is similar to twistd tool in twisted framework, base code was taken from twisted, just use --help to
find out available options.
