NodeSet right now is on rapid development. Code will be changed and APIs too.

* NodeSet Framework

NodeSet is based on Foolscap[1] RPC and twisted[2]. This framework provides a way to build distributed services
on top of publish/subscribe interface. Each Node is a separate unix process, and all events delivering are performed
by dispatcher, the special unix process (also based on foolscap RPC).

* NodeSet components:
1. EventDispatcher - runs on its own, just listen for incoming foolscap RPC calls, and trace which nodes are available,
    and its health.
2. Node - Each Node can act as publisher, as well as subscribers. 
 2.1 StreamNode - special node for streaming. Streaming performed without dispatcher, to avoid performance penalty.

Well, it all about publish/subscribe idea.

* Goals
 - Distributed (each host has only one dispatcher, but many nodes. Events can be delivered between hosts)
 - Stateless (any node doesn't rely to dispatcher, if dispatcher will die, it does not affect nodes, as well as
     death of any nodes, does not affect other nodes and dispatcher)
 - Async (as well NodeSet is based on twisted, it's all about async programming :)
